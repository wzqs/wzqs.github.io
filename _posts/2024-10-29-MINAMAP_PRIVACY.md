**Overview**

MinaMap is a Chrome extension designed to visualize $MINA transaction flows. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to not collecting any user data.

**Data Collection Statement**

MinaMap does NOT:
- Collect any personal identification information
- Track your browsing history
- Store any user data
- Share any information with third parties

**Permissions Explanation**

Our extension requests the following permissions solely for basic functionality:

1. `storage`: Used only for storing extension settings locally
2. `activeTab`: Used to display transaction flow diagrams in the current tab
3. `webRequest`: Used to read public transaction data from Mina blockchain explorers

These permissions are never used to collect or transmit any user data.

**Data Security**

Since we do not collect any user data, there is no risk of data breaches. All functionality operates locally within your browser.
